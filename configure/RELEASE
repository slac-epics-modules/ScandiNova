# Define the version strings for all needed modules
# Use naming pattern:
#   FOO_MODULE_VERSION = R1.2
# so scripts can extract version strings
# Don't set your version to anything such as "test" that
# could match a directory name.

# External Support module path definitions
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains an "include" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler include path.
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains a "lib/<arch>" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler link path for that architecture.
#
# If your build fails, look for these paths in your build output
